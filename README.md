Getting Started
IMPORTANT: Read the Access Control guide before performing any further steps. The default Dashboard deployment contains a minimal set of RBAC privileges needed to run.

To deploy Dashboard, execute following command:

$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
To access Dashboard from your local workstation you must create a secure channel to your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following command:

$ kubectl proxy
Now access Dashboard at your browser:

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/.


Create An Authentication Token (RBAC)
To find out how to create sample user and log in follow Creating sample user guide.

NOTE:

Kubeconfig Authentication method does not support external identity providers or certificate-based authentication.
Dashboard can only be accessed over HTTPS
Heapster has to be running in the cluster for the metrics and graphs to be available. Read more about it in Integrations guide.
